# Portfolio_project2
This is an extension of my original exercise app that has 2 components added. First I added an 'add new task' component that allows the user to click the add button and be taken to a new screen where the user can create a title name and exercise type name and save it to the screen to be returned. Second, I implemented a component that keeps track of what time the user starts, the time the user pauses, and the timers minutes and seconds that they reset at.
